// Minimal HTML entity decoder shared by the scraping providers whose sources
// return raw HTML (as opposed to a JSON API). Handles named entities (&amp;,
// &lt;, …) and numeric entities (&#252; / &#xfc;).
//
// Previously duplicated verbatim across deutschebahn.mjs and hecklerkoch.mjs
// (CodeRabbit finding on #1555) — same drift risk flagged separately on
// successfactors.mjs/dassault.mjs/softgarden.mjs/rheinmetall.mjs (#1639),
// where a numeric-entity range guard drifted out of sync between copies:
// checking only Number.isFinite still lets String.fromCodePoint throw a
// RangeError for a code point above 0x10FFFF (e.g. `&#99999999;`), crashing
// the entire parse for a single malformed/adversarial entity. Centralized
// here so the guard can't diverge again.
//
// The guard drifted a third time before this file caught up with it: the
// jobvite provider (#2623) grew its own copy that was STRICTER than this one,
// rejecting code points that are legal to construct but not legal to emit.
// That strictness is now here, in isEmittableCodePoint below, which is the
// point of a shared decoder — the improvement should not have had to live in
// one provider.
//
// The hex/decimal alternatives are matched separately (not "#x?[0-9a-fA-F]+")
// so a decimal entity can never absorb trailing hex letters — "&#1a2;" no
// longer silently parses as codepoint 1 and drops "a2"; it just fails to
// match and passes through untouched, same as any other malformed entity.

/**
 * Whether a numeric reference names a code point this decoder will emit.
 *
 * The set is XML 1.0 §2.2 Char. That standard is used rather than a bare
 * `code <= 0x10FFFF` bound because the bound only prevents fromCodePoint from
 * throwing — it says nothing about whether the result is safe to put in a job
 * title. It admits NUL, the C0 controls, and the two noncharacters U+FFFE and
 * U+FFFF, all of which fromCodePoint will happily emit.
 *
 * That matters because of where the output goes. A decoded title is not
 * displayed and discarded: it is written to the scan history, the pipeline, the
 * tracker, and every document generated downstream. A NUL or a lone surrogate
 * entering there is not a rendering artefact — it truncates C-string-backed
 * consumers, produces ill-formed UTF-8 on serialization, and is tedious to
 * trace back to one malformed entity in one posting weeks later. The feed host
 * controls this input, so "no legitimate page does that" is not a guarantee.
 *
 * Tab, LF and CR are explicitly kept: they are legal per §2.2, they appear in
 * real postings, and the callers already normalize whitespace.
 *
 * NaN needs no separate guard — it fails every comparison below — so this one
 * predicate subsumes the previous Number.isFinite / >= 0 / <= 0x10FFFF /
 * surrogate checks, and fromCodePoint cannot throw on what survives it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here: the HTML5 windows-1252 remap of C1 references
 * (`&#146;` → U+2019). Those code points are legal under §2.2, so they pass
 * through and decode to the raw C1 control exactly as before. Adding that
 * mapping is a real improvement for the HTML providers, but it changes output
 * rather than rejecting bad input, so it belongs in its own change.
