// tests/local-today-gates.test.mjs — every place that asks "what day is it"
// must answer with the LOCAL calendar day, not the UTC one (#3070).
//
// #2765 fixed followup-seed, #2932 fixed set-status's two. These are the rest,
// and each GATES a decision rather than stamping a filename:
//
//   scan.mjs                 `today < cooldownUntil` — a posting the user
//                            silenced until a date resurfaces a day early
//   followup-cadence.mjs     the follow-up due decision
//   check-table-freshness    `expired`, which exits 1 — a CI gate
//   funnel-velocity.mjs      the "waiting" figure
//   company-history.mjs      the `now` all age math runs against
//   assessment-log.mjs       the date written into a user's assessments.tsv row
//
// PINNED INSTANT, not the wall clock. The window where the UTC day and the
// local day disagree only exists for part of the UTC day, so a test that reads
// `new Date()` passes for most of the day regardless of the bug — which is how
// this survived two previous fixes.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/local-today-gates.test.mjs

 * Evaluate an expression in a child pinned to a timezone AND a frozen clock.

 * Freezing matters more than the timezone. Without it these assertions compare
 * whatever `new Date()` returns during the run, so they agree with the UTC day
 * for most of the day and pass whether the fix is present or not — a test that
 * measures nothing for 20-odd hours out of 24. The first draft of this file did
 * exactly that and passed with the fix reverted.
 *
 * `Date` is replaced before the module under test is imported, and the default
 * parameters being tested read the clock at CALL time, so the freeze reaches
 * them.
