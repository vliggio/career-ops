// the sandbox so the copy can still resolve its package imports. symlinkSync
// succeeds against a target that does not exist, so on a checkout where
// dependencies were never installed the link is created dangling, the child
// process dies with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and the section's catch reports that
// as a crash of whatever the test was actually about. That is a red assertion
// pointing at innocent code.
//
// The suite is designed to run on a fresh clone with only Node (see the
// tests/helpers.mjs header), where an absent node_modules is the expected state
// and has to be reported as itself.
