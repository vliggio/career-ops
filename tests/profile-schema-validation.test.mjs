// tests/profile-schema-validation.test.mjs — config/profile.yml is the one
// config file nothing checked the shape of.
//
// It steers scoring targets, output language, spend tier, CV format and
// location policy. doctor.mjs checked that it EXISTS; every reader then does
// `profile?.language?.output` and takes the fallback when the key is absent —
// which is indistinguishable from the key being MISSPELLED:
//
//     langauge:          # <- parses cleanly, validates nowhere
//       output: ja
//     spend_teir: premium
//
// English output at the default tier, no signal anywhere. The user's only clue
// is noticing the wrong language in finished work.
//
// portals.yml has validate-portals.mjs and the plugin registry has
// validate-plugin-registry.mjs; this is the same family for the file that had
// none.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/profile-schema-validation.test.mjs
